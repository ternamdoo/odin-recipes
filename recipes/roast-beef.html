    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds beef eye of round roast, at room temperature</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder, or more to taste</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>Make sure roast is at room temperature. Tie roast at 3-inch intervals with cotton twine; this helps it from
            drying out and allows it to cook more evenly. Place roast on a rack in a baking pan.</li>
        <li>Mix together salt, garlic powder, and pepper in a small bowl. Rub seasoning mixture into the meat.</li>
        <li>Place in the preheated oven and roast for 60 minutes, or 20 minutes per pound if your roast is larger or
            smaller. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 120 to 125 degrees F (49 to 52
            degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and transfer to a cutting board. Cover loosely with foil, and let rest so juices can
            redistribute, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slice and serve.</li>
    </ol>
